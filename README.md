## Description

**scDART** (**s**ingle **c**ell **D**eep learning model for **A**TAC-Seq and **R**NA-Seq **T**rajectory integration) is a scalable deep learning framework that embed the two data modalities of single cells, scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, into a shared low-dimensional latent space while preserving cell trajectory structures. Furthermore, **scDART** learns a nonlinear function represented by a neural network encoding the cross-modality relationship simultaneously when learning the latent space representations of the integrated dataset.
